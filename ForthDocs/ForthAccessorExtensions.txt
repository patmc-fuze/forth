# Forth Accessor extensions
#
#####################################################################################

This is a major change to Forth that allows variable/members to have special characters
appended to their base symbols to do common operations which would normally require
several forth operations to be executed with a single opcode, these are things like
adding directly to a variable and incrementing loop variables:

  6 a!          // store 6 into a
  3 a+!         // add 6 to a
  a--@          // decrement a then push its value
  a&            // push the address of a
  a             // push the value stored in a
  a(ix)         // push the value stored in array a at index ix

Methodology: look at common usage of important types, see what syntax would work
The aim is to produce something which:
o adds value for common access cases
o does not do unexpected things
o doesn't support infinitely extendability like:
  like array(ii).struct.memberArray(jj).foo@++

The syntax extensions are only applied to the last member of an accessor chain.

Is it better to encode things like 'fetch pointer' as distinct from 'fetch cell'?
It would make displaying things in the debugger more obvious, and could also
make compilation less complicated, but would be less bit efficient.

b   ub  s   us  i   ui  l   ul  f   d

Maybe the best choice would be:
1) implement the basics - a a@ a! a+! a-!
2) have local and member combo ops that push var address and then execute an op, like:
  a @++   // instead of a@++ as a single symbol
This wouldn't require any opcode changes, just outer interpreter work.

This doesn't answer what to do about objects, in particular about '->o' and 'oclear'.
I suppose '!' could mean assign-with-no-addref, '+!' could mean assign-and-addref,
'-!' could mean oclear, but it seems sucky.
? or maybe keep oclear as is?

current idea:
^!      to store and increment refcount
^-      to clear and decrement refcount
!       store leaving refcount untouched
